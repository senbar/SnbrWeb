<h1>About author</h1>
Hi! My name is Bartosz, I am professional Xamarin developer currently working freelance in Poland. I study mathematics at University of Silesia and learned programming on my own. The intent behind creating this blog was to exercise my writing and write down my thoughts on various subject, mosty programming. I guess we will see how this turns out.
